Changes in Part 1:

HTML files:
Added the line [<link href="gutenberg-part1.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>] which sets the stylesheet of the html files to be gutenberg-part1.css so it looks like how I configured. Also deleted the overlapping properties found within the embedded css for each HTML file so it uses the stylesheet I provided.

Paragraphs:
Indented by 1em and centered the text to make it look cleaner and more like a scroll.

Body:
Added a cool old style burnt scroll background to reflect the nature of the books since they are all old. Also changed the font and justified the text.

Headers:
Header text style was set to Italic and given bold weight. In addition, also changed font size to large to make it stand out more and gave it a gold background in line with the scroll theme I mentioned. Also changed font family to ['Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif] which is just a personal preference.

Images:
Centered the images within the HTML to make it look cleaner. Also changed image to be a block element rather than inline since I think inline images don't look ideal.

Colour Scheme:
Changed background to an old burned paper look that I thought had a scroll like feel since I picked old books!
